   The code is mainly some algorithms , which is got from the book "Introduction to algorithms".
When reading this book , I think that I should code them because that is very funny.
   If you want to get the ideas of these algorithms , you can refer to the book . It is really easy to
read and understand for the writer's rich knowledge.
   It is mainly use python(or C) to write them.I am sorry for my English,because It is not my native language.
